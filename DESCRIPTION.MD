# Our Solution

## Monitoring with a smartwatch
<p align="justify>
The smartwatch can be rolled out in line with HPBâ€™s National Steps Challenge where step trackers are issued to participants. 
An opt-in approach can be rolled out to elderlies living alone to allow the step trackers to act as a monitoring device and 
alert SCDF and CFRs at the onset of incidents which require emergency responses. </p>

## Suspected cardiac arrest 
<p align="justify>
When irregular heartbeats are detected, and the wearer is deemed to be suffering from a suspected cardiac arrest, a beep will 
be sent out from the smartwatch. Should the wearer not turn off the beep within 60 seconds, an alert will be sent to both SCDF 
and nearby CFRs. The beeping noise will continue until it is turned off to allow responders to locate the subject more efficiently.
A stopwatch will be started from the time of the beep to allow responders to know how much time has passed.</p>

## Falls
<p align="justify>
When a falling motion and impact, followed by a period of no movement is detected, a beep will be sent out from the smartwatch. 
Should the wearer not turn off the beep within 60 seconds, an alert will be sent to both SCDF and nearby CFRs. The beeping noise 
will continue until it is turned off to allow responders to locate the subject more efficiently. A stopwatch will be started from 
the time of the beep to allow responders to know how much time has passed.</p>

<p align="justify>
If the wearer falls and is conscious, but unable to get up, the wearer can activate a SOS button to alert both SCDF and nearby CFRs 
of the incident. A stopwatch will be started from the time the SOS button is activated to allow responders to know how much time has 
passed.</p>


## Community First Responders
<p align="justify>
Nearby CFRs will be alerted of the incident via the myResponder app. Should they choose to respond, they will receive a message with 
the OTP needed to open the smart door to ensure they have access to provide timely intervention.</p>
